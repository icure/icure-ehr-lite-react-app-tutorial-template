# icure-ehr-lite-react-app-tutorial-template
This template is a starting point for creating your own PetraCare app. It includes all the frontend components and resources based on the EHR Lite SDK but does not include the SDK integration itself. Use this repo as an accelerator to customize and integrate the SDK on your own to build the full PetraCare app.
